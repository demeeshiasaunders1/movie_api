**Assignment Title:** Building a Movie Info App using the OMDB API and ReactJS

**Assignment Description:**

For this project, you'll be creating a movie information app using ReactJS and the OMDB API, called "MyMovieInfo". Your task will be to fetch and display information about a movie entered by the user.

**Requirements:**

1. **Create a Search Component:** This component should include an input field for users to enter a movie name, and a button to submit the search. On clicking the button or pressing Enter, your app should make a request to the OMDB API and fetch data about the movie.

2. **Display Movie Data:** Create a Movie Component to display the information about the movie. It should display the following details fetched from the API: Title, Year of Release, Genre, Director, Actors, Plot Summary, Language, Country, Awards, IMDb rating, and a Poster. Note: not all movies will have all details, so make sure your code can handle missing data gracefully.

3. **Handle Errors:** Make sure your app can handle situations where the movie is not found or the API request fails. Display a friendly error message in these situations.

4. **Styling:** Use CSS to style your application, ensuring it is mobile-responsive. You can use libraries like Bootstrap, or CSS in JS libraries like styled-components, if you wish.

5. **Code Organization:** Your code should be well organized, with different components kept in separate files and imported as needed. Remember to follow best practices for naming variables, functions, etc. Your application should be easy to read and understand by others.

**Bonus:**

1. **Movie List:** Add a feature that allows users to maintain a list of their favorite movies. Users should be able to add the current movie to the list, view the list, and remove movies from the list.

2. **Additional Movie Details:** Add more movie details like Box Office, Production company, and Ratings from different platforms.

3. **Loading State:** While fetching data from the OMDB API, display a "loading..." message or a spinner.

**Submission:**

You'll be submitting your code via GitHub. Please commit your work regularly, with clear, descriptive commit messages so that I can see the progression of your work. 

**Evaluation:**

Your project will be evaluated on the following:

1. Functionality: Does the application function as expected and meet the project requirements?
2. Code Quality: Is the code well-organized and easy to read? Are variables and functions appropriately named? Are best practices followed?
3. Error Handling: How does the application handle potential errors, such as the API request failing, or the movie not being found?
4. Design & User Experience: Is the application easy to use? Does it provide a good user experience?
5. Completion of Bonus Tasks (if attempted)

Good luck! I'm looking forward to seeing your creative solutions. Remember, the goal is to learn and enjoy the process. Feel free to collaborate and help each other, but the final work should be your own. Happy coding!
